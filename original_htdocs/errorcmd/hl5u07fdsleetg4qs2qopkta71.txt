General options:

-h or -help
	Output help information.
-synopsis or -info
	Output synopsis for clusterer (use in conjunction  with -h)
-t <name of training file>
	Sets training file.
-T <name of test file>
	Sets test file.
-l <name of input file>
	Sets model input file.
-d <name of output file>
	Sets model output file.
-p <attribute range>
	Output predictions. Predictions are for training file
	if only training file is specified,
	otherwise predictions are for the test file.
	The range specifies attribute values to be output
	with the predictions. Use '-p 0' for none.
-x <number of folds>
	Only Distribution Clusterers can be cross validated.
-s <random number seed>

Options specific to weka.clusterers.HierarchicalClusterer:

-D
	If set, classifier is run in debug mode and

	otherwise it is node height.
-N <Nr Of Clusters>
